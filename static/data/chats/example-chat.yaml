      To create a custom component in Docusaurus, you'll need to:
      
      1. Create your React component in the `src/components` directory
      2. Import it in your MDX files
      3. Use it directly in your markdown
      
      Would you like me to show you an example?

      Here's a simple example of a React component for Docusaurus:
      
      ```jsx
      import React from 'react';
      
      export function MyCustomComponent({ children }) {
        return (
          <div className="my-custom-component">
            {children}
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```
      
      You'd use it in your MDX file like this:
      
      ```mdx
      import { MyCustomComponent } from '@site/src/components/MyCustomComponent';
      
      # My Page
      
      <MyCustomComponent>
        This content is rendered by my custom component!
      </MyCustomComponent>
      ```
